This is an experiment ticket bot made using TypeScript with discord.js. This bot was made ~~because I wanted to how powerful djs is~~ to showcase functioning of djs v13.

## Prerequistics

### [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/)

To run and install the dependencies, Node.js 16.6.0 or newer is required.

### [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

Git is required to clone this repo locally

## Running

Running this bot is as simple as running a normal ts/js project

* Clone this repo using `git clone https://github.com/DriftAsimov/Sanae-chan/`
* Do `cd Sanae-chan`
* Now run `npm install` which will install the requirements
* Create a `.env` file in current directory taking format from [env.example](env.example)
* Now to run the bot you can either do `ts-node src/index.ts` or `npm run build` and then `npm start`
* If you wanna use it for development, you can use `nodemon src/index.ts` to watch over your files

If everything goes alright then the bot should be online!

### P.S.

This is my first time using djs so ofc there would be bad practices and feel free to bug me about them! ~~I even need to work on error handling so yeah~~
